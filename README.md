## Accessibility

After applying changes to the code, might be a good idea to pass the new version of
the application through an accessibility tool such as [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/).

There is also a [browser](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) extension which makes
testing the development version much easier.
